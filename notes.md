This project, titled "Player Finder– Game Rental & Management System", is developed to manage the rental and scheduling of physical games and gaming platforms, such as indoor games, outdoor sports, and online café-based games. The system is designed to streamline the entire booking process for users and businesses, making it more efficient, transparent, and secure.
The platform allows users to browse, search, and filter games based on categories, city, and pricing. Users can view detailed game information, check availability, and book time slots as per their preferences. The system includes Razorpay payment integration, enabling secure and seamless online payments for game rentals.
One of the core features is the schedule management system, which ensures that no double bookings occur. It validates time slots and prevents users from selecting already reserved slots. Upon successful booking, users receive confirmation along with details of the game, schedule, and payment summary. The system also maintains an order history for users, making it easy to track previous bookings.
For businesses, Player Finder  provides tools to manage their listed games, track purchases made by users, and monitor total earnings and rental activity through a structured backend. The system stores each rental transaction with details such as the game, user, date, schedule, quantity, and total price.
Overall, Player Finder simplifies and digitizes the physical game rental process. It ensures a smooth experience for users while giving game providers a reliable way to manage their rentals, schedules, and revenue—all in one integrated system.
